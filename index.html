            <div class="bigWord Lexical">
                What is Lexical Environment?
                <div class="defn Lexical">
                    It is an environment where something sits physically in the code you write.
                    It is something you do with words or grammers. For instance
                    <code>function selam(){var x="morning"}</code> The variable x sits lexically on selam function.
                    <strong>A new lexical scope is created everytime you type a function definition. Only curly you defined in a function creates a new scope.</strong>

                What is Execution Context?
                <div class="defn Execution">
                    A wrapper to help manage the code that is running. There are lots of lexical environment. Which one is currently running is managed by execution environment. When JS is executed an execution context is created. At the base level (when you are not in a function), global object (window in case of browser), this (special variable), outer environment are created. Finally the execution context is running your code. There are two phases in execution context. First phase : Creation Phase: variables, functions and memory are set up. Second phase:Execution phase: Running code line by line.
                    <strong>It differs from lexical scope because it built as the code runs</strong>

                What is hoisting in JavaScript?
                <div class="defn Object">
                    JavaScript engine setup a memory space for variables and functions before entire code is running. Example if we run the following codes, the second code output is undefined because memory space for a is already setup <code>var a="helloWorld!!!";<br /> console.log(a);<br /> <output style=" color:#000fff; display:inline; font-style: italic;">"HelloWorld"</output></code>

            <div class="bigWord ">
                Explain event delegation?
                <div class="defn ">
                    JavaScript event delegation is a simple technique by which you add a single event handler to a parent element in order to avoid having to add event handlers to multiple child elements. Event delegation allows you to avoid adding event listeners to specific nodes;  instead, the event listener is added to one parent.  That event listener analyzes bubbled events to find a match on child elements.The event delegation helps to simplify event handling by smart use of bubbling and target element. <strong> </strong>
                    <strong>If there are many element inside one parent, and you want to handle events on them of them - don’t bind handlers to each element. Instead, bind the single handler to their parent, and get the child from event.target.</strong>

            <!--EventDelegationHow-->
            <div class="bigWord EventDelegationHow">
                How event delegation works?
                <div class="defn EventDelegationHow">
                    When an event is triggered on an element, for example a mouse click on a button, the same event is also triggered on all of that element’s ancestors. This process is known as event bubbling. the event bubbles up from the originating element to the top of the DOM tree. The target element of any event is the originating element, the button in our example, and is stored in a property of the event object. Using event delegation it’s possible to add an event handler to an element, wait for an event to bubble up from a child element and easily determine from which element the event originated.
                    <code>
                        function getEventTarget(e) {
                        e = e || window.event;
                        return e.target || e.srcElement;
                        }

            <!--prototype-->
            <div class="bigWord Prototype">
                Explain how prototypal inheritance works
                <div class="defn Prototype">
                    In JavaScript, the inheritance is prototype-based. That means that there are no classes. Instead, an object inherits from another object.
                    Prototypes are the mechanism by which JavaScript objects inherit features from one another, and they work differently to inheritance mechanisms in classical object-oriented programming languages.
                    JavaScript is often described as a prototype-based language — each object has a prototype object, which acts as a template object that it inherits methods and properties from. An object's prototype object may also have a prototype object, which it inherits methods and properties from, and so on. This is often referred to as a prototype chain, and explains why different objects have properties and methods defined on other objects available to them.
                    When it comes to inheritance, JavaScript only has one construct: objects. Each object has an internal link to another object called its prototype. That prototype object has a prototype of its own, and so on until an object is reached with null as its prototype. null, by definition, has no prototype, and acts as the final link in this prototype chain.
                    <code>
                        var animal = { eats: true }
                        var rabbit = { jumps: true }
                        rabbit.__proto__ = animal  // inherit
                        alert(rabbit.eats) // true

            <!--AMD and commonJS-->
            <div class="bigWord AMDCommonJS">
                What do you think of AMD vs CommonJS?
                <div class="defn ">
                    <div>
                        Asynchronous module definition (AMD) is a specification for the programming language JavaScript. It defines an application programming interface (API) that defines code modules and their dependencies, and loads them asynchronously if desired.
                        Its overall goal is to provide a solution for modular JavaScript that developers can use today.
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        CommonJS are a volunteer working group which aim to design, prototype and standardize JavaScript APIs. To date they've attempted to ratify standards for both modules and packages. The CommonJS module proposal specifies a simple API for declaring modules server-side and unlike AMD attempts to cover a broader set of concerns such as io, filesystem, promises and more. CommonJS is a project that aims to define a series of specifications to help in the development of server-side JavaScript applications.

                    <div>
                        The main difference between AMD and CommonJS lies in its support for asynchronous module loading.

            <!--IIFE-->
            <div class="bigWord IIFE">
                Explain why the following doesn't work as an IIFE:<code>function foo(){ }()</code>. What needs to be changed to properly make it an IIFE?
                <div class="defn IIFE">
                    An immediately-invoked function expression (or IIFE, pronounced "iffy") is a JavaScript programming language idiom which produces a lexical scope using JavaScript's function scoping.It is a JavaScript function that runs as soon as it is defined. It is also an anonymous function that is created and then immediately invoked. It's not called from anywhere else (hence why it's anonymous), but runs just after being created.
                    when the parser encounters the function keyword, it treats it as a function declaration (statement), and not as a function expression. Because of that
                    <code>function foo(){ }()</code> doesn't work.
                    The following are common conventions to explicitly tell the parser to expect an expression.
                    <code>
                        (function foo(){ ... }());(function foo(){ ... })(); +function foo(){ ... }();!function foo(){ ... }();~function foo(){ ... }();-function foo(){ ... }();
                    </code>
                    <strong>
                        Lexical scoping (sometimes known as static scoping ) is a convention used with many programming languages that sets the scope (range of functionality) of a variable so that it may only be called (referenced) from within the block of code in which it is defined.
                    </strong>
                    IIFE is used to place all lirary code inside of a local scope.

                What's the difference between a declaration and definition?
                <div class="defn Declaration">
                    Declaration is when you ask a compiler or interpreter to create a new variable give it a name while definition is when you assign a value in that variable.
                    <code>
                        var x; // declaration
                        x = "Selam"; // definition

                What's coercion mean in JavaScript?
                <div class="defn Coercion">
                    Type coercion means that when the operands of an operator are different types, one of them will be converted to an "equivalent" value of the other operand's type(123 + "4") or if you do: var x =1; var y=true;
                    y == x
                    the boolean operand will be converted to an integer: false becomes 0, true becomes 1. Then the two values are compared.
                    However, if you use the non-converting comparison operator ===, no such conversion occurs. When the operands are of different types, this operator returns false, and only compares the values when they're of the same type.
                    <veryImportant style=" font-style: italic;display:block; border:0.2em #123456 dashed; padding:0.5em">
                        Converting a value from one type to another is often called "type casting," when done explicitly, and "coercion" when done implicitly (forced by the rules of how a value is used).

                What's the difference between a variable that is: null, undefined or undeclared?
                <div class="defn UndefinedNull">
                    undefined is a variable that has been declared but no value exists and is a type of itself 'undefined'. null is a value of a variable and is a type of object. We use console.log(); and type of to check if a variable is undefined or null . undeclared variables is a variable that has been declared without var keyword
                    <code>
                        null === undefined // false

                What is a closure, and how/why would you use one?
                <div class="defn Closure">
                    JavaScript variables can belong to the local or global scope. Private variables can be made possible with closures. Closures are functions that refer to independent (free) variables (variables that are used locally, but defined in an enclosing scope). In other words, these functions 'remember' the environment in which they were created.
                    <code>
                        var add = (function () { var counter = 0;
                        return function () {return counter += 1;}})();
                    </code>
                    <strong>
                        The variable add is assigned the return value of a self-invoking function. The self-invoking function only runs once. It sets the counter to zero (0), and returns a function expression. This way add becomes a function. The "wonderful" part is that it can access the counter in the parent scope. This is called a JavaScript closure. It makes it possible for a function to have "private" variables. The counter is protected by the scope of the anonymous function, and can only be changed using the add function.

                What's a typical use case for anonymous functions?
                <div class="defn ">
                    An anonymous function is a function that is not stored in a program file, but is associated with a variable whose data type is function_handle . Anonymous functions can accept inputs and return outputs, just as standard functions do. However, they can contain only a single executable statement. Functions stored in variables do not need function names. They are always invoked (called) using the variable name.

                    In JS every element that holds properties and methods is an object except primitive data types.
                    There are three object categories in JavaScript: Native Objects, Host Objects, and User-Defined Objects.
                    Native objects are those objects supplied by JavaScript, whose semantics are fully defined by ECMAScript specification rather than by the host environment.. Examples of these are String, Number, Array, Image, Date, Math, Object (constructor), parseInt, eval, string methods like indexOf and replace, array methodsetc.
                    Host objects are objects that are supplied to JavaScript by the browser (host) environment. Examples of these are window, document, forms, location, history, XMLHttpRequest, setTimeout, getElementsByTagName, querySelectorAll etc.
                    User-defined objects are those that are defined by the programmer.

                        A function defined by <strong>a function expression</strong> inherits the current scope. That is, the function forms a closure. On the other hand, a function defined by a <strong>Function constructor</strong> does not inherit any scope other than the global scope (which all functions inherit). Functions defined by function expressions and function declarations are parsed only once, while those defined by the Function constructor are not. That is, the function body string passed to the Function constructor must be parsed each and every time the constructor is called. Although a function expression creates a closure every time, the function body is not reparsed, so function expressions are still faster than "new Function(...)". Therefore the Function constructor should generally be avoided whenever possible. Function declarations in JavaScript are hoisting the function definition.

                    <strong>Function.prototype.apply()</strong>
                    The apply() method calls a function with a given this value and arguments provided as an array (or an array-like object).  Syntax
                    <code>fun.apply(thisArg, [argsArray])</code>
                    <strong>Function.prototype.call()</strong>
                    The call() method calls a function with a given this value and arguments provided individually. Syntax
                    <code>
                        fun.call(thisArg[, arg1[, arg2[, ...]]])

                    <strong>Function.prototype.bind()</strong>
                    The bind() method creates a new function that, when called, has its this keyword set to the provided value, with a given sequence of arguments preceding any provided when the new function is called.
                    Syntax
                    <code>

                    The bind() function creates a new bound function (BF). A BF is an exotic function object (a term from ECMAScript 2015) that wraps the original function object. Calling a BF generally, results in the execution of its wrapped function.

            <div class="bigWord ">
                What's the difference between feature detection, feature inference, and using the UA string?
                <div class="defn ">
                    Feature detection involves working out whether a browser supports a certain block of code, and running different code dependant on whether it does (or doesn't), so that the browser can always provide a working experience rather crashing/erroring in some browsers. Example
                    <code>
                        if("geolocation" in navigator) { <br />
                        navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(function(position) { <br />
                        // show the location on a map, perhaps using the Google Maps API <br />
                        }); <br />
                        }  <br />
                        else {   <br />
                        // Give the user a choice of static maps instead perhaps <br />
                        }   <br />
                    </code>
                    Feature inference is assuming that because you've detected one feature that you can use other features. For example if you detect the geolocation API maybe you'd assume your user is on a modern browser and so now LocalStorage is available. It's usually bad to assume so you're much better off just using feature detection for each feature you want to take advantage of, and have a fallback strategy in place in the event a feature isn't available. Even if a user has a modern browser with geolocation doesn't mean they're going to allow your app to use it so plan accordingly.
                    In computing, a user agent (UA string) is software (a software agent) that is acting on behalf of a user. One common use of the term refers to a web browser telling a web site information about the browser and operating system. This allows the web site to customize content for the capabilities of a particular device, but also raises privacy issues. It is super old system.

                    HTTP headers allow the client and the server to pass additional information with the request or the response.
                    A request header consists of its case-insensitive name followed by a colon ':', then by its value (without line breaks).
                    <ul style="margin:0em;">

                            <strong>Expires:  -</strong> The Expires header contains the date/time after which the response is considered stale/not fresh.
                            Invalid dates, like the value 0, represent a date in the past and mean that the resource is already expired.
                            If there is a Cache-Control header with the "max-age" or "s-max-age" directive in the response, the Expires header is ignored.

                            <strong>If-Modified-since: - </strong>The If-Modified-Since request HTTP header makes the request conditional:
                            the server will send back the requested resource, with a 200 status, only if it has been last modified after the given date.
                            If the request has not been modified since, the response will be a 304 without any body; the Last-Modified header will
                            contain the date of last modification. Unlike If-Unmodified-Since, If-Modified-Since can only be used with a GET or HEAD.

                            <strong>Cache-Control: - </strong>The Cache-Control general-header field is used to specify directives for caching mechanisms
                            in both, requests and responses. Caching directives are unidirectional, meaning that a given directive in a request is not
                            implying that the same directive is to be given in the response.

                            It allows caches to be more efficient, and saves bandwidth, as a web server does not need to send a full response
                            if the content has not changed. On the other side, if the content has changed, etags are useful to help prevent
                            simultaneous updates of a resource from overwriting each other ("mid-air collisions").

                            JavaScript Typically JavaScript is used to handle work that will result in visual changes,
                            whether it’s jQuery’s animate function, sorting a data set, or adding DOM elements to the page.
                            It doesn’t have to be JavaScript that triggers a visual change, though:
                            CSS Animations, Transitions, and the Web Animations API are also commonly used.
                        </li>

                            Style calculations. This is the process of figuring out which CSS rules apply to which elements based on matching
                            selectors, for example, .headline or .nav > .nav__item. From there, once rules are known, they are applied and
                            the final styles for each element are calculated.
                        </li>
                        <li style="margin-left: 1.6em;">
                            Layout. Once the browser knows which rules apply to an element it can begin to calculate how much space it takes up
                            and where it is on screen. The web’s layout model means that one element can affect others, for example the width of
                            the element typically affects its children’s widths and so on all the way up and down the tree, so the process can be
                            quite involved for the browser.

                            Paint. Painting is the process of filling in pixels. It involves drawing out text, colors, images, borders, and shadows,
                            essentially every visual part of the elements. The drawing is typically done onto multiple surfaces, often called
                            layers.

                            Compositing. Since the parts of the page were drawn into potentially multiple layers they need to be drawn to the screen
                            in the correct order so that the page renders correctly. This is especially important for elements that overlap another,
                            since a mistake could result in one element appearing over the top of another incorrectly.

Invalid inputs should prompt appropriate error messages. In web applications, functional testing can range from testing whether links are working to checking whether changes made by users in a web page are reflected in the database. Some of the functional tests for web applications include: <strong>Database testing, Configuration testing,Compatibility testing & Flow testing </strong>

Each unit is tested separately before integrating them into modules to test the interfaces between modules. Unit testing has proven its value in that a large percentage of defects are identified during its use.

                Difference between document load event and document ready event?
                <div class="defn LoadReadyEvent">
                    The load event is fired when a resource and its dependent resources have finished loading. While the ready event is fired a little bit earlier
                    <code>
                        &lt;script&gt;
                        window.addEventListner("load",function(event){
                        console.log("run after all resources are loaded!!!");

                        &lt;/script&gt;
                    </code>
                    The ready event occurs after the HTML document has been loaded, while the onload event occurs later, when all content (e.g. images) also has been loaded. The onload event is a standard event in the DOM, while the ready event is specific to jQuery. The purpose of the ready event is that it should occur as early as possible after the document has loaded, so that code that adds functionality to the elements in the page doesn't have to wait for all content to load.

            <div class="bigWord UseStrict">
                What is "use strict";? what are the advantages and disadvantages to using it?
                <div class="defn UseStrict">
                    Strict Mode is a new feature in ECMAScript 5 that allows you to place a program, or a function, in a “strict” operating context. This strict context <strong> prevents certain actions from being taken and throws more exceptions </strong> (generally providing the user with more information and a tapered-down coding experience). Since ECMAScript 5 is backwards-compatible with ECMAScript 3, all of the “features” that were in ECMAScript 3 that were “deprecated” are just disabled (or throw errors) in strict mode, instead.
                    <ul style="margin:0em;">
                        Strict mode helps out in a couple ways:
                        <li style="margin-left: 1.6em;">It catches some common coding bloopers, throwing exceptions.</li>
                        <li style="margin-left: 1.6em;">It prevents, or throws errors, when relatively “unsafe” actions are taken (such as gaining access to the global object).</li>
                        <li style="margin-left: 1.6em;">It disables features that are confusing or poorly thought out </li>
                    </ul>
                    In general Strict mode makes several changes to normal JavaScript semantics. First, strict mode eliminates some JavaScript silent errors by changing them to throw errors. Second, strict mode fixes mistakes that make it difficult for JavaScript engines to perform optimizations: strict mode code can sometimes be made to run faster than identical code that's not strict mode. Third, strict mode prohibits some syntax likely to be defined in future versions of ECMAScript.
                    <code>
                        (function(){
                        "use strict"; <br />
                        //Define your library strictly
                        })();
                    </code>
                    Its disadvantage is Browsers not supporting strict mode will run strict mode code with different behavior from browsers that do, so don't rely on strict mode without feature-testing for support for the relevant aspects of strict mode.

                <div class="defn ">
                    In JavaScript there are two sets of equality operators. First === or !== these operator compares both the value and type. For instance
                    <code>
                        "10"===10; <output style=" color:#000fff; display:inline; font-style: italic;">false</output>

                    </code>
                    On the other hand == or != compares only the value.
                    <code>
                        "10"===10; <output style=" color:#000fff; display:inline; font-style: italic;">true</output>

                    The conditional (ternary) operator is the only JavaScript operator that takes three operands. The name ternary means composed of three parts. This operator is frequently used as a shortcut for the if statement. Syntax

                    An HTML attribute is a modifier of an HTML element type. An attribute either modifies the default functionality of an element type or provides functionality to certain element types unable to function correctly without them. In HTML syntax, an attribute is added to an HTML start tag.
                    Example
                    <code>

                    JavaScript is designed on a simple object-based paradigm. An object is a collection of properties, and a property is an association between a name (or key) and a value. A property's value can be a function, in which case the property is known as a method.

                    <code>

                <div class="defn Promise">
                    The Promise object is used for asynchronous computations. A Promise represents a value which may be available
                    <em>now,or in the future, or never</em>. Syntax <code> new Promise( /* executor */ function(resolve, reject) { ... } );</code>
                    <veryImportant style=" font-style: italic;display:block; border:0.2em #123456 dashed; padding:0.5em">
                        executor: - A function that is passed with the arguments resolve and reject. The executor function is executed immediately
                        by the Promise implementation, passing resolve and reject functions (the executor is called before the Promise constructor
                        even returns the created object). The resolve and reject functions, when called, resolve or reject the promise, respectively.
                        The executor normally initiates some asynchronous work, and then, once that completes, either calls the resolve function to
                        resolve the promise or else rejects it if an error occurred. If an error is thrown in the executor function, the promise is
                        rejected. The return value of the executor is ignored.
                    </veryImportant>
                    A Promise is a proxy/representative for a value not necessarily known when the promise is created. It allows you to associate
                    handlers with an asynchronous action's eventual success value or failure reason. This lets asynchronous methods return values
                    like synchronous methods: instead of immediately returning the final value, the asynchronous method returns a promise to supply
                    the value at some point in the future.

                    </code>
                    The <strong>onreadystatechange</strong> property of the object handles the server response. This is done by setting the onreadystatechange
                    property of the object to the name of the JavaScript function that should be called when the state of the request changes.
                    <code>

                        };

                    After you declare the function you need to call the open and send methods of the XMLHttpRequest request class.
                    <code>
                        httpRequest.open('GET', 'http://www.example.org/some.file', true);
                        httpRequest.send(null);

                    </code>
