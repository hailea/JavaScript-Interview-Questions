                                XHTML stands for EXtensible HyperText Markup Language. It is HTML defined as an XML application
                                XHTML is supported by all major browsers. It is almost identical but stricter than HTML.
                                In XHTML
                                <blockquote>
                                    DOCTYPE is mandatory. The xmlns attribute in html is also mandatory. html, head, title and body are mandatory.
                                    XHTML elements must be properly nested, always be closed, must be in lowercase.
                                    XHTML documents must have one root element. Attribute names must be in lower case. Attribute values must be quoted.

                        <li>
                            Unlike HTML, XHTML is an XML-based markup language. The syntax of XML is slightly different from that of HTML, and
                            XML processors are less forgiving if you make mistakes. XML-based content development puts a lot of emphasis on well-formedness
                            and validity, and can be readily integrated with all the processing tools, data, and automation available in the XML world.
                            Many developers prefer to use XHTML because of the advantages XML's rigor brings for editing or processing of documents.

       <!--block line elements and inline elements-->
       <div class="bigWord">
                What is the difference between block line elements and inline elements?
            <div class="defn">
                HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) elements are usually either "block-level" elements or "inline" elements.
                A block-level element occupies the entire space of its parent element (container), thereby creating a "block."
              Example article, aside, blockquote, p, footer, h1-h6
                An inline element occupies only the space bounded by the tags that define the inline element.
                Example big, i, small, abbr, acronym, cite, em, kbd, var,

       <!--multiple languages in a page-->
       <div class="bigWord">
          How do you serve a page with content in multiple languages?
          <div class="defn">
              Language tags are used to indicate the language of text or other items in HTML and XML documents.
              Use the lang attribute to specify language tags in HTML, and the xml:lang attribute for XML.
              or Use the lang attribute for pages served as HTML, and the xml:lang attribute for pages served as XML
              <blockquote>
                  By getting the server to send the information in the HTTP Content-Language header. Example<code>Content-Language: en, hi, pa</code>
                  The HTTP Content-Language header can be used to provide metadata about the intended audience of the page,
                  and can indicate that this is more than one language.
                  The Content-Language value for an http-equiv attribute on a meta element should no longer be used.
                  You should always use a language attribute on the html tag to declare the default language of the actual text in the page.

             WebSockets is an advanced technology that makes it possible to open an interactive communication session between the user's browser and a server.
             With this API, you can send messages to a server and receive event-driven responses without having to poll the server for a reply.

                XMLHttpRequest is an API that provides client functionality for transferring data between a client and a server.
                It provides an easy way to retrieve data from a URL without having to do a full page refresh.
                This enables a Web page to update just a part of the page without disrupting what the user is doing.
                 XMLHttpRequest is used heavily in AJAX programming.

                     WebRTC (Web Real-Time Communications) is a technology which enables Web applications and sites to capture and optionally stream audio
                    and/or video media, as well as to exchange arbitrary data between browsers without requiring an intermediary. The set of standards that
                    comprises WebRTC makes it possible to share data and perform teleconferencing peer-to-peer, without requiring that the user install
                plug-ins or any other third-party software.

        <!--data attributes-->
        <div class="bigWord">
                What are data- attributes good for?
            <div class="defn"><ul>
                            <li>
                                Any attribute on any element whose attribute name starts with data- is a data attribute.
                                data-* attributes allow to store extra information or custom data private to the page or application on standard, semantic HTML elements
                                without other hacks such as non-standard attributes, extra properties on DOM.
                                They gives us the ability to embed custom data attributes on all HTML elements.
                                The stored (custom) data can then be used in the page's JavaScript to create a more engaging user experience (without any Ajax calls or server-side database queries).
                                The data-* attributes consist of two parts:
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                The attribute name should not contain any uppercase letters, and must be at least one character long after the prefix "data-"
                                The attribute value can be any string
                                Note: Custom attributes prefixed with "data-" will be completely ignored by the user agent.
                            </li>

       <!--cookie, session storage and local storage-->
         <div class="bigWord">
             What is the diffrenece between cookie, sessionStorage and localStorage?
             <div class="defn">
                 With HTML5, web pages can store data locally within the user’s browser. Earlier, this was done with cookies.
                 However, Web Storage is more secure and faster. The data is not included with every server request, but used ONLY when asked for.
                 The data is stored in name/value pairs, and a web page can only access data stored by itself.
                 <ul>
                     <li> Unlike cookies, the storage limit is far larger (at least 5MB) and information is never transferred to the server.</li>
                     <li>The difference between localStorage and sessionStorage involves the lifetime and scope of the storage.</li>
                     <li> Data stored through localStorage is permanent it does not expire and remains stored on the user’s computer</li>
                     <li> until a web app deletes it or the user asks the browser to delete it.</li>
                     <li> SessionStorage has the same lifetime as the top-level window or browser tab in which the script that stored it is running.</li>
                     <li> When the window or tab is permanently closed, any data stored through sessionStorage is deleted.</li>
                     <li> Both forms of storage are scoped to the document origin so that documents with different origins will never share the stored objects.</li>
                     <li> But sessionStorage is also scoped on a per-window basis. If a user has two browser tabs displaying documents from the same origin,</li>
                     <li> those two tabs have separate sessionStorage data the scripts running in one tab cannot read or overwrite the data written by</li>
                     <li> scripts in the other tab, even if both tabs are visiting exactly the same page and are running exactly the same scripts.</li>
                     <li> HTML local storage provides two objects for storing data on the client i.e. localStorage and sessionStorage.</li>
                     <li> Web applications can store data locally within the user's browser (Information is never transferred to the server).</li>
                     <li> They are more secure and large amounts of data can be stored locally, without affecting website performance (atleast 5MB).</li>
                     <li> Local storage is per origin (per domain and protocol). All pages, from one origin, can store and access the same data.<dt>window.localStorage - stores data with no expiration date</dt><dt>window.sessionStorage - stores data for one session (data is lost when the browser tab is closed)</dt></li>
                     <li> cookie can be used to store data on the local and they can be read only by the server and its maximum size is 4096bytes (4KB).</li>
                     <li> Cookies are included with every HTTP request, thereby slowing down your web application by transmitting the same data.</li>
                     <li> Cookies are included with every HTTP request, thereby sending data unencrypted over the internet.</li>
                     <li> Cookies are limited to about 4 KB of data . Not enough to store required data.</li>

                    If neither async or defer is present The script is fetched and executed immediately, before the browser continues parsing the page.
                    Putting your scripts at the bottom of the page body, lets the browser load the page first.
                    position CSS at the head to download the styles as quick as possible.
                 If you want to a script to execute early, before the page is displayed put it at the head otherwise at the end

                What is the difference between canvas and SVG?
                <div class="defn">
                  canvas is an HTML element which can be used to draw graphics using scripting (usually JavaScript).
                 This can, for instance, be used to draw graphs, make photo composition or simple (and not so simple) animations.
                 Draw graphics, on the fly, via scripting (usually JavaScript).
                 Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) is an XML-based markup language for describing two-dimensional vector graphics.
                SVG is essentially to graphics what HTML is to text. SVG is similar to Adobe's proprietary Flash technology,
                but it is a text-based open Web standard instead of a closed binary format.
                It is explicitly designed to work with other web standards such as CSS, DOM, and SMIL.
                 In general as the size of the screen increases, canvas begins to degrade as more pixels need to be drawn.
                As the number of objects increases on the screen, SVG begins to degrade as we are continually adding them to the DOM
