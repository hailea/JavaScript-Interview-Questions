                                XHTML stands for EXtensible HyperText Markup Language. It is HTML defined as an XML application
                                XHTML is supported by all major browsers. It is almost identical but stricter than HTML.
                                In XHTML
                                <blockquote>
                                    DOCTYPE is mandatory. The xmlns attribute in html is also mandatory. html, head, title and body are mandatory.
                                    XHTML elements must be properly nested, always be closed, must be in lowercase.
                                    XHTML documents must have one root element. Attribute names must be in lower case. Attribute values must be quoted.

                        <li>
                            Unlike HTML, XHTML is an XML-based markup language. The syntax of XML is slightly different from that of HTML, and
                            XML processors are less forgiving if you make mistakes. XML-based content development puts a lot of emphasis on well-formedness
                            and validity, and can be readily integrated with all the processing tools, data, and automation available in the XML world.
                            Many developers prefer to use XHTML because of the advantages XML's rigor brings for editing or processing of documents.

       <!--block line elements and inline elements-->
       <div class="bigWord">
                What is the difference between block line elements and inline elements?
            <div class="defn">
                HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) elements are usually either "block-level" elements or "inline" elements.
                A block-level element occupies the entire space of its parent element (container), thereby creating a "block."
              Example article, aside, blockquote, p, footer, h1-h6
                An inline element occupies only the space bounded by the tags that define the inline element.
                Example big, i, small, abbr, acronym, cite, em, kbd, var,

       <!--multiple languages in a page-->
       <div class="bigWord">
          How do you serve a page with content in multiple languages?
          <div class="defn">
              Language tags are used to indicate the language of text or other items in HTML and XML documents.
              Use the lang attribute to specify language tags in HTML, and the xml:lang attribute for XML.
              or Use the lang attribute for pages served as HTML, and the xml:lang attribute for pages served as XML
              <blockquote>
                  By getting the server to send the information in the HTTP Content-Language header. Example<code>Content-Language: en, hi, pa</code>
                  The HTTP Content-Language header can be used to provide metadata about the intended audience of the page,
                  and can indicate that this is more than one language.
                  The Content-Language value for an http-equiv attribute on a meta element should no longer be used.
                  You should always use a language attribute on the html tag to declare the default language of the actual text in the page.

             WebSockets is an advanced technology that makes it possible to open an interactive communication session between the user's browser and a server.
             With this API, you can send messages to a server and receive event-driven responses without having to poll the server for a reply.

                XMLHttpRequest is an API that provides client functionality for transferring data between a client and a server.
                It provides an easy way to retrieve data from a URL without having to do a full page refresh.
                This enables a Web page to update just a part of the page without disrupting what the user is doing.
                 XMLHttpRequest is used heavily in AJAX programming.

                <div class="defn">
                     WebRTC (Web Real-Time Communications) is a technology which enables Web applications and sites to capture and optionally stream audio
                    and/or video media, as well as to exchange arbitrary data between browsers without requiring an intermediary. The set of standards that
                    comprises WebRTC makes it possible to share data and perform teleconferencing peer-to-peer, without requiring that the user install
                plug-ins or any other third-party software.

        <!--data attributes-->
        <div class="bigWord">
                What are data- attributes good for?
            <div class="defn"><ul>
                            <li>
                                Any attribute on any element whose attribute name starts with data- is a data attribute.
                                data-* attributes allow to store extra information or custom data private to the page or application on standard, semantic HTML elements
                                without other hacks such as non-standard attributes, extra properties on DOM.
                                They gives us the ability to embed custom data attributes on all HTML elements.
                                The stored (custom) data can then be used in the page's JavaScript to create a more engaging user experience (without any Ajax calls or server-side database queries).
                                The data-* attributes consist of two parts:
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                The attribute name should not contain any uppercase letters, and must be at least one character long after the prefix "data-"
                                The attribute value can be any string
                                Note: Custom attributes prefixed with "data-" will be completely ignored by the user agent.
                            </li>
                            <li>Example article[data-columns='3'] { width: 400px;} article[data-columns='4'] { width: 600px; }</li>

       <!--cookie, session storage and local storage-->
         <div class="bigWord">
             What is the diffrenece between cookie, sessionStorage and localStorage?
             <div class="defn">
                 With HTML5, web pages can store data locally within the user’s browser. Earlier, this was done with cookies.
                 However, Web Storage is more secure and faster. The data is not included with every server request, but used ONLY when asked for.
                 The data is stored in name/value pairs, and a web page can only access data stored by itself.
                 <ul>
                     <li> Unlike cookies, the storage limit is far larger (at least 5MB) and information is never transferred to the server.</li>
                     <li>The difference between localStorage and sessionStorage involves the lifetime and scope of the storage.</li>
                     <li> Data stored through localStorage is permanent it does not expire and remains stored on the user’s computer</li>
                     <li> until a web app deletes it or the user asks the browser to delete it.</li>
                     <li> SessionStorage has the same lifetime as the top-level window or browser tab in which the script that stored it is running.</li>
                     <li> When the window or tab is permanently closed, any data stored through sessionStorage is deleted.</li>
                     <li> Both forms of storage are scoped to the document origin so that documents with different origins will never share the stored objects.</li>
                     <li> But sessionStorage is also scoped on a per-window basis. If a user has two browser tabs displaying documents from the same origin,</li>
                     <li> those two tabs have separate sessionStorage data the scripts running in one tab cannot read or overwrite the data written by</li>
                     <li> scripts in the other tab, even if both tabs are visiting exactly the same page and are running exactly the same scripts.</li>
                     <li> HTML local storage provides two objects for storing data on the client i.e. localStorage and sessionStorage.</li>
                     <li> Web applications can store data locally within the user's browser (Information is never transferred to the server).</li>
                     <li> They are more secure and large amounts of data can be stored locally, without affecting website performance (atleast 5MB).</li>
                     <li> Local storage is per origin (per domain and protocol). All pages, from one origin, can store and access the same data.<dt>window.localStorage - stores data with no expiration date</dt><dt>window.sessionStorage - stores data for one session (data is lost when the browser tab is closed)</dt></li>
                     <li> cookie can be used to store data on the local and they can be read only by the server and its maximum size is 4096bytes (4KB).</li>
                     <li> Cookies are included with every HTTP request, thereby slowing down your web application by transmitting the same data.</li>
                     <li> Cookies are included with every HTTP request, thereby sending data unencrypted over the internet.</li>
                     <li> Cookies are limited to about 4 KB of data . Not enough to store required data.</li>

                                Modules that are in the revising phase are much less stable than those in the refining phase.
                                Often the syntax is still under scrutiny and may evolve a lot, in a non-compatible way.
                                Alternative syntaxes are tested and often implemented.

                What's the difference between "resetting" and "normalizing" CSS? Which would you choose, and why?<div class="defn" Normalize.css is a small CSS file that provides better cross-browser consistency in the default styling of HTML elements.</div>
                <div class="defn" It’s a modern, HTML5-ready, alternative to the traditional CSS reset.</div><div class="defn" A CSS Reset (or “Reset CSS”) is a short, often compressed (minified) set of CSS rules that resets the styling of all</div>
                <div class="defn" HTML elements to a consistent baseline. Using a CSS Reset, CSS authors can force every browser to have all its styles reset to null, thus avoiding cross-browser differences as much as possible.</div>

                                By applying display:none you made inaccesible for screen readers. The best way is to make the value of top and left

                <div class="defn" CSS has always been used to lay out our web pages, but it's never done a very good job of it.</div>
                <div class="defn" First we used tables, then floats, positioning and inline-block, but all of these methods were essentially hacks and</div>
                <div class="defn" left out a lot of important functionality (vertical centering, for instance).</div>
                <div class="defn" Flexbox helped out, but it's intended for simpler one-dimensional layouts, not complex two-dimensional ones</div>
                <div class="defn" (Flexbox and Grid actually work very well together).</div>
                <div class="defn" Grid is the very first CSS module created specifically to solve the layout problems we've all been hacking our way around</div>

                <div class="defn" scope by using media features, such as width, height, and color. The result of the query is true if the media type</div>
                <div class="defn" specified in the media query matches the type of device the document is being displayed on and all expressions in the media query are true.</div>
                <div class="defn" You can use logical operators Example @media (min-width 700px), handheld and (orientation landscape) { ...styles... }</div>

            <!--styling SVG-->


            <div class="bigWord">

                <div class="defn" It can be used for static images, and also for animations and user interfaces.</div>
                <div class="defn" Like other XML-based languages, SVG supports CSS stylesheets so that you can separate the style of a graphic from its content.</div>
                <div class="defn" The SVG document links the stylesheet in the usual way.</div>
                <div class="defn" SVG has its own CSS properties and values. Example fill, fillrule, stroke, stop-opacity, stop-color,clip-path, clip-rule</div>
                <div class="defn" Some of them are similar to CSS properties for HTML. Example font, display, font-size</div>

                            <dt>
                                It is a separate stylesheet language with advanced features that developers can leverage to create leaner,
                                faster products with more features while spending less time on the whole process than they would with plain CSS.

                                They are fully compatible with CSS – in fact, they are normal CSS to the end user! As the name implies, these stylesheet languages
                                are turned into normal CSS files, which are then displayed on the user’s computer.
                                This solves both the development and the compatibility problems in one fell swoop – quite ingenious, isn’t it?

                                The two most popular CSS preprocessors are LESS and SASS, though – they’re mature, well supported, have a clearly

                Other major advantages – nested syntax, variables, mixins, extends, a host of operational and mathematical functions,
                as well as file concatenation, all of which add to a better development process, which results in better CSS
                Mixins and extends also reduce the number of lines you need to write as a developer by providing reusable pieces of code and class inheritance –
                no more typing the same parameters for every object on your site/app.

                <div class="defn"<dt>Disadvantages</dt></div>need to learn and get used to a new language
                It needs experience besides HTML and CSS, otherwise you may find yourself creating CSS files that are way larger than they should be
                which directly affect load speed.

                Setting up the CSS preprocessor requires some command line knowledge, and naturally it uses CPU time to run

                code maintenance can be complicated when using a CSS preprocessor, even though one of their claimed advantages is making
                code maintenance easier. It’s easy to use non-standard code with a preprocessor, and one property (in a separate location)
                can affect multiple end files, so if there’s ever a problem, searching for the culprit can be a lot harder

            <!--box model-->


            <div class="bigWord">
                Explain your understanding of the box model and how you would tell the browser in CSS to render your layout in different box models.<div class="defn" All HTML elements can be considered as boxes. In CSS, the term "box model" is used when talking about design and layout.</div>
                <div class="defn"> The CSS box model is essentially a box that wraps around every HTML element.
                     It consists of margins, borders, padding, and the actual content.
                      When you set the width and height properties of an element with CSS, you just set the width and height of the content area.
                To calculate the full size of an element, you must also add padding, borders and margins.</div>

            <div class="bigWord">
                What does * { box-sizing: border-box; } do? What are its advantages?
                <div class="defn">
                 When you set box-sizing border-box; on an element, the padding and border of that element no longer increase its width.
                The width and height properties (and min/max properties) includes content, padding and border, but not the margin.
            </div>
            <div class="defn" The box-sizing property can make building CSS layouts easier and a lot more intuitive. It is in experimental.</div>
            <div class="defn" The box-sizing property is used to alter the default CSS box model used to calculate width and height of the elements.</div>
            <div class="defn" It is possible to use this property to emulate the behavior of browsers that do not correctly support the CSS box model specification.</div>
