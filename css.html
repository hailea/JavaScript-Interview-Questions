                What are the novelities of CSS3?
                <div class="defn">
                  The aim of CSS3 is to extend CSS2.1 and it has some existing features.
                 Rounded corners, transition, animation, shadows, gradients are some of the new features.

            <div class="bigWord">
                What are the modules and standardization process of CSS3?
                <div class="defn">
                  The standardization process of CSS is module by module.
                                Modules under the catagory of candidate recommendation, proposed recommendation or recommendation are stable modules.
                                These modules can be used with out prefix. For instance pseudo elements, pseudo classes, background, border
              <br />Modules under refining phase are fairly stable. Though changes are still expected. CSS animations and CSS transitions are in this phase
                            <br />
                                Modules that are in the revising phase are much less stable than those in the refining phase.
                                Often the syntax is still under scrutiny and may evolve a lot, in a non-compatible way.
                                Alternative syntaxes are tested and often implemented.
                            <br />
                            There are also modules that are in exploring phase and rewriting phase

            <div class="bigWord">
                What's the difference between "resetting" and "normalizing" CSS?
                 Which would you choose, and why?
                 <div class="defn">
                   Normalize.css is a small CSS file that provides better cross-browser consistency in the default styling of HTML elements.
                  It’s a modern, HTML5-ready, alternative to the traditional CSS reset.
                 A CSS Reset (or “Reset CSS”) is a short, often compressed (minified) set of CSS rules that resets the styling of all.
                 HTML elements to a consistent baseline. Using a CSS Reset, CSS authors can force every browser to have all its styles reset to null, thus avoiding cross-browser differences as much as possible.

              What is float property in CSS3 and how they work?
              <div class="defn">
                The float property specifies whether or not an element should float.
                It can be used to wrap text around images. .someClassNme{float:right;}

                <div class="defn">
                  The z-index property specifies the stack order of an element.
                An element with greater stack order is always in front of an element with a lower stack order.

                Describe BFC(Block Formatting Context) and how it works.
                <div class="defn"> A block formatting context is a part of a visual CSS rendering of a Web page.
                It is the region in which the layout of block boxes occurs and in which floats interact with each other.

                <div class="defn">
                  Image sprites are used in numerous web apps where multiple images are used. Rather than include each image as a separate image file.
                it is much more memory and bandwidth-friendly to send them as a single image, so the number of HTTP requests is reduced.
                 CSS sprites is the technique of combing images to lessen the number of calls that need to be made to the server.

            <div class="bigWord">
                Describe grid system?
                <div class="defn"> Grid is in W3 working draft stage and it is not supported by all browsers correctly. Example safari, ios, android.
                 CSS Grid Layout (aka "Grid" ), is a two-dimensional grid-based layout system that aims to change the way we design grid-based user interfaces.
                 CSS has always been used to lay out our web pages, but it's never done a very good job of it.
                 First we used tables, then floats, positioning and inline-block, but all of these methods were essentially hacks and
                 left out a lot of important functionality (vertical centering, for instance).
                 Flexbox helped out, but it's intended for simpler one-dimensional layouts, not complex two-dimensional ones.
                 (Flexbox and Grid actually work very well together).
                 Grid is the very first CSS module created specifically to solve the layout problems we've all been hacking our way around.
                 for as long as we've been making websites.

            <div class="bigWord">
                Explain the implementation of media queries or mobile specific layouts/CSS.
                <div class="defn">
                  A media query implementation consists of an optional media type and zero or more expressions that limit the style sheets.
                 scope by using media features, such as width, height, and color. The result of the query is true if the media type.
                 specified in the media query matches the type of device the document is being displayed on and all expressions in the media query are true.</div>
                 You can use logical operators Example @media (min-width 700px), handheld and (orientation landscape) { ...styles... }

            <!--styling SVG-->


            <div class="bigWord">
                Are you familiar with styling SVG?
                <div class="defn"> SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) is an XML-based language for creating graphics.
                It can be used for static images, and also for animations and user interfaces.
                 Like other XML-based languages, SVG supports CSS stylesheets so that you can separate the style of a graphic from its content.
                 The SVG document links the stylesheet in the usual way.
                 SVG has its own CSS properties and values. Example fill, fillrule, stroke, stop-opacity, stop-color,clip-path, clip-rule.
                 Some of them are similar to CSS properties for HTML. Example font, display, font-size

                            <dt>It is an extension of CSS.</dt>

                                It is a separate stylesheet language with advanced features that developers can leverage to create leaner,
                                faster products with more features while spending less time on the whole process than they would with plain CSS.
                            </dt>

                                They are fully compatible with CSS – in fact, they are normal CSS to the end user! As the name implies, these stylesheet languages
                                are turned into normal CSS files, which are then displayed on the user’s computer.
                                This solves both the development and the compatibility problems in one fell swoop – quite ingenious, isn’t it?

                                The two most popular CSS preprocessors are LESS and SASS, though – they’re mature, well supported, have a clearly

                Other major advantages – nested syntax, variables, mixins, extends, a host of operational and mathematical functions,
                as well as file concatenation, all of which add to a better development process, which results in better CSS
                Mixins and extends also reduce the number of lines you need to write as a developer by providing reusable pieces of code and class inheritance –
                no more typing the same parameters for every object on your site/app.

                It needs experience besides HTML and CSS, otherwise you may find yourself creating CSS files that are way larger than they should be
                which directly affect load speed.

                Setting up the CSS preprocessor requires some command line knowledge, and naturally it uses CPU time to run

                code maintenance can be complicated when using a CSS preprocessor, even though one of their claimed advantages is making
                code maintenance easier. It’s easy to use non-standard code with a preprocessor, and one property (in a separate location)
                can affect multiple end files, so if there’s ever a problem, searching for the culprit can be a lot harder

                 A web design comp might represent the graphical layout of a full website, a page or a banner.
                The graphic layout is separate from the web coding. Some web designers focus on writing the code that
                makes the web site technically ready for the internet, but the comp represents what the final site will be visually.
                 A comp of a large web site might include many separate pages. It allows the designers to make decisions about how they direct

                 <div class="defn">
                   All HTML elements can be considered as boxes. In CSS, the term "box model" is used when talking about design and layout.
                   The CSS box model is essentially a box that wraps around every HTML element.
                     It consists of margins, borders, padding, and the actual content.
                      When you set the width and height properties of an element with CSS, you just set the width and height of the content area.
                To calculate the full size of an element, you must also add padding, borders and margins.</div>

                 When you set box-sizing border-box; on an element, the padding and border of that element no longer increase its width.
                The width and height properties (and min/max properties) includes content, padding and border, but not the margin.
            The box-sizing property can make building CSS layouts easier and a lot more intuitive. It is in experimental.
             The box-sizing property is used to alter the default CSS box model used to calculate width and height of the elements.
            It is possible to use this property to emulate the behavior of browsers that do not correctly support the CSS box model specification.
